# Url Shortener Code Test

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app to create shorter copies of URLs. It stores them in a hash and doesn't write information entered into a database.  

The app is deployed here: [https://shortly2015.herokuapp.com/](https://shortly2015.herokuapp.com/)

To run it locally clone this folder to your desktop and cd into it via your Terminal. 

If you have Rails installed run the following commands:  
- `$ bundle install`  
- `$ rake db:migrate`  
- `$ rails server`  
  
  
This app comes included with tests for the `urls_controller`. You can run the tests with `$ rspec`.
